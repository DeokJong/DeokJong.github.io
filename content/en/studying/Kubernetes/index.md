Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). As a container orchestration tool, Kubernetes clusters containers across multiple hosts, ensuring the availability and scalability of applications.

# What is Kubernetes?

## Open-source platform

Kubernetes is open-source software, meaning anyone can use, modify, and distribute the source code freely.

## Containerized applications

Containers package applications with their dependencies, ensuring they run consistently across different environments. Docker is a well-known container technology.

## Automated deployment, scaling, and management

Kubernetes automatically deploys containerized applications, scales them as needed, and continuously manages them. This allows developers to focus on application development without worrying about infrastructure management.

## Developed by Google

Kubernetes was originally developed by Google based on their internal Borg system. It was later open-sourced and has since received contributions from a large community.

## Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)

Kubernetes is now maintained by the CNCF, a nonprofit organization that supports the development and adoption of cloud-native applications.

## Container orchestration tool

Kubernetes clusters containers across multiple hosts, ensuring application availability and scalability. For example, if one server goes down, Kubernetes ensures that the application continues running on other servers.

## Summary

Kubernetes is a powerful tool for efficiently managing containerized applications. It reduces the complexity of infrastructure management while ensuring the availability and scalability of applications.
