This project is a toy project designed to enhance both backend and frontend development skills, as well as improve collaboration abilities. The project builds an online shopping mall based on the store "Cotton Gallery," involving the design, implementation, and deployment of the entire backend and frontend systems. It includes the implementation of essential e-commerce features, such as user management, product browsing, and order processing. The goal is to deploy the system to the cloud and establish an automated CI/CD pipeline.
