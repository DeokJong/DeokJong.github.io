  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) helps manage code complexity by specifying the relationships between functions and the objects they act upon. This intermediate course introduces OOP using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is useful for everyday R programming, while R6 is particularly handy for working with web APIs and building GUIs.

## Introduction

I am DeokJong Jin, a senior student at Jeonbuk National University's Department of Computer and Artificial Intelligence. I have worked on both Backend and Frontend projects and am currently honing my skills as a DevOps developer.

I have undertaken the following projects:

1. A simple game development project to learn Java and object-oriented programming.
2. A multi-PC monitoring system.
3. The ONE Fitness CRM project.

Through these projects, I gained experience designing web interfaces with React and integrating APIs. I also built servers and developed RESTful APIs using FastAPI.
