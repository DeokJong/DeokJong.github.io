## Introduction

My name is DeokJong Jin, currently a senior year student at Jeonbuk National University in the School of Computer Artificial Intelligence. I have experience working on both backend and frontend projects, and I’m currently building my skills as a DevOps developer.

I have worked on the following projects:

1. A simple game project to learn Java and object-oriented programming.
2. A multi-PC monitoring system.
3. The ONE Fitness CRM project.

Through these projects, I gained experience in web design using React and connecting APIs. Additionally, I built a server using FastAPI and developed RESTful APIs.
